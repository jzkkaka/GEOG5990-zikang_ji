This is the first part of the Python assessment.

# The list of file

1. agentframework.py        (the framework)
2. final.py                 (the main program)
3. in.txt

# Overview of the program

This is a simple program to show 10 sheeps eats the grass. In the program, we use 10 points as the sheep, and programing them to moving randomly in the environment. We remove the part of the environment that the 'sheep' had passed, acting like they 'eat' the grass.

# Run mode

Press the Run file(F5) in final.py, there will be two new window pop-up in Spyder, model and figure 1. Then click the button model in the model, and click run model in the pull-down menu. The program should run automatically at the window model.

# What should show in the program

There should be a environment as the background which is the prairie. 10 dots should be at the top left corner at the begining as the sheeps, and then all move randomly over the 'prairie' one grid in one move, and 'eat' every grass they had walk through. And the iterations would be 100.

# What more could show in the program

There could be more creatures in the environemnt, to creat a more complex ecological environment. For example, the wolf who could eat the sheep, and the hunter who would wipe out them both.
